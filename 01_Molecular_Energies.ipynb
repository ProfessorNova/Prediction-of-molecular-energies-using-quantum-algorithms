    "But first what is the energy of a molecule? In quantum mechanics, the energy of a system is described by an operator called the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "It is basically a sum of terms that represent different interactions within the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{tot} = \\hat{T}_N + \\hat{T}_e + \\hat{V}_{eN} + \\hat{V}_{NN} + \\hat{V}_{ee}$$\n",

    "- $\\hat{T}_e$ is the kinetic energy of the electrons\n",
    "- $\\hat{V}_{eN}$ is the potential energy due to attraction between electrons and nuclei\n",
    "- $\\hat{V}_{NN}$ is the potential energy due to repulsion between nuclei\n",
    "- $\\hat{V}_{ee}$ is the potential energy due to repulsion between electrons\n",
    "\n",
