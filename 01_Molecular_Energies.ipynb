Notice that the sign of the amplitude has changed, which is a result of the **anti-commutation relations**. This is not just a quirk of the **Jordan-Wigner transformation**, but a fundamental property of **fermions**, as exchanging two fermions results in a change of sign of the wavefunction. Digging deeper into this topic would lead us astray, so we will leave it at that for now.\n",

This means that we have created a **superposition of states** where the electrons are in both orbitals at the same time. This is why in the unitary we have both the term **$a_2^\\dagger a_3^\\dagger a_1 a_0$** which moves the electrons from orbital 1 to orbital 2, and the term **$a_0^\\dagger a_1^\\dagger a_3 a_2$** which moves them back again.\n",

If we were to consider only the **nuclear attraction** and **kinetic energy** terms, moving an electron to a higher energy orbital would always increase the energy. However, by creating a **superposition of states**, we can reduce the overall **electron-electron repulsion**, which can lead to a lower total energy.\n",
